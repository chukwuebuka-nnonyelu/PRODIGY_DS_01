# Age Distribution Analysis

## Overview

This project visualizes the distribution of ages from a dataset containing individuals aged 17 to 90. The purpose is to explore the demographic distribution and derive insights into the age groups represented.

## Visualization

I used a bar chart to represent the frequency of occurrences for each age group. The chart highlights the most and least represented age groups in the dataset. You can view the chart [here](https://github.com/chukwuebuka-nnonyelu/PRODIGY_DS_01/blob/main/Age%20Distribution%20Viz.xlsx).

## Key Insights

- **Main Insight**: The most dominant age group is 26-35 years, with a total of 8,514 persons.
- **Secondary Insight**: The least dominant age group is 76-90 years, with a toal of 241 persons.

## Methodology

- The original dataset was gotten [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset)
- Data ranges from ages 17 to 90.
- Ages were grouped into intervals.
- The chart was created using Excel.
