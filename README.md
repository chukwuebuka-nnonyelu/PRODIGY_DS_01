# Age Distribution Analysis

## Overview

This project visualizes the distribution of ages from a dataset containing individuals aged 17 to 90. The purpose is to explore the demographic distribution and derive insights into the age groups represented.

## Visualization

I used a bar chart to represent the frequency of occurrences for each age group. The chart highlights the most and least represented age groups in the dataset. You can view the chart [here](link-to-chart).

## Key Insights

- **Main Insight**: [Explain any significant trends, e.g., most dominant age group].
- **Secondary Insight**: [Discuss any other observations, such as gaps between age groups or surprising distributions].

## Methodology

- Data ranges from ages 17 to 90.
- Ages were grouped into intervals of [e.g., 5 or 10 years].
- The chart was created using [mention any tools/libraries such as Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn), R, or Excel].

## Conclusion

This analysis provides a snapshot of the age distribution within the dataset. The visualization and insights can be useful for [specific use cases, further research, or related projects].
